## 😊 Welcome
This repository stores crime data files collected from the Kaggle API. After my friends and I(over 10 victims) experienced a series of burglaries last winter in Nottingham, where we suffered the loss of laptops, bluetooth headphones, cameras, and bikes (our unluckiest friend Yichen experienced burglaries three times, losing property worth £6000), I’m really hoping to find somewhere with better public safety to move to.
